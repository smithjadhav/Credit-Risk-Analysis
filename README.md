# Credit-Risk-Analysis
In this project We have put ourself in the shoes of a loan issuer and manage credit risk by using the past data and deciding whom to give the loan in the future. 
The text files contain complete loan data for all loans issued by XYZ Corp.through 2007-2015. The data contains the indicator of default, payment information, credit history, etc.
The data should be divided into train (June 2007 - May 2015) and out-of-time test (June 2015 - Dec 2015) data. You will have use the training data to build models/analytical solution and finally apply it to test data to measure the performance and robustness of the models. 
Objective : 
You have to build a data model to predict the probability of default, and choose a cut-off based on what you feel is suitable. Alternatively you can also use a modelling technique which gives binary output.
You have to do the following:
Based on the data that is available during loan application, build a model to predict default in the future. This will help the company in deciding whether or not to pass the loan.
Also note that the data contains defaulters, successful payers and customers who were current during that time. To simplify the problem, customers under 'current' status have been considered as non-defaulters in the dataset.

Steps to be followed (tentative time required):
1) Understand the problem and objective 
2) Understand the data and develop some business sense. 
3) EDA, segmentation . 
4) Data Cleaning 
5) Feature engineering 
6) Model Building 
7) Testing and Cross-validation 
8) Final results, recommendations and plots/visualizations.
